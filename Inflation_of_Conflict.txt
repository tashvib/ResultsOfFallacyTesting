Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The statement uses language that suggests only these specific choices exist ("Neither one of them knows what they are talking about, so I should just skip studying altogether")
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The statement excludes other possibilities by dismissing both parents' suggestions and jumping to skipping studying
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - Additional reasonable options exist, such as studying for 1 hour, 1.5 hours, or finding a compromise between the parents' suggestions
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - The statement forces a choice to skip studying while ignoring other legitimate study time possibilities

For Distinction Without a Difference:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The argument claims there is a meaningful distinction between Raisinets and other candies based on having "40% less fat"
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The claimed difference is based primarily on different language - "40% less fat" sounds healthier but the comparison is only to candy bars, not all candies
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - In practice, Raisinets are still candy with similar nutritional profile to other candies, just compared to a specific subset (candy bars)
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The marketing argument's conclusion that Raisinets are a better choice depends on this supposed distinction being valid
Pattern comparison: My answers [Y/Y/Y/Y] exactly match ground truth [Y/Y/Y/Y]

For False Dilemma:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The statement presents only two choices: religion being wrong about "a few things" versus science being wrong about "many more things"
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The statement uses implicit either/or language suggesting these are the only two relevant comparisons to consider
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The statement excludes other possibilities such as both being right in different domains, or the complexity of comparing different types of knowledge claims
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - Additional reasonable options exist, such as acknowledging that religion and science address different types of questions, or that both have been both right and wrong in different contexts
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - The statement forces a choice between viewing religion as less wrong or science as more wrong, while ignoring other legitimate ways to understand the relationship between religious and scientific knowledge

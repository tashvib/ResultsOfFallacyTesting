#classification: Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle#
#
For Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - There is a categorical syllogism structure with premises (his house is half the size of most houses, most houses have standard doors) and conclusion (his doors must be 3 1/2 feet high)
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - Both premises link different categories (his house and door height) to the same middle term (house size), and the conclusion directly links his house to door height
Step 3 evaluation: No - There is no additional valid reasoning or evidence provided to justify that smaller house size necessarily means proportionally smaller doors
Pattern comparison: My answers [Yes, Yes, No] exactly match ground truth [Yes, Yes, No]

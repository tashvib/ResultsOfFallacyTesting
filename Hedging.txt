#classification: Fallacy of Every and All#
#
For Fallacy of Every and All:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The statement contains universal quantifiers ("All women are") and existential qualifiers ("the ones I know")
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - A claim is made with quantifiers in a specific order ("All women are evil" followed by "the ones I know")
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The conclusion reverses the order by limiting the universal claim to only specific women he knows
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The reversed order changes the logical meaning from a universal statement about all women to a limited statement about known women
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - The term "all women" is used equivocally, first meaning literally all women, then meaning only the women he knows
Pattern comparison: My answers [Y/Y/Y/Y/Y] exactly match ground truth [Y/Y/Y/Y/Y]

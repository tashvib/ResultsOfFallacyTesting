#classification: Confusing Currently Unexplained with Unexplainable#
#
For Confusing Currently Unexplained with Unexplainable:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - Terrence mentions that he doesn't know how the keys got in his pocket, acknowledging something currently unexplained
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - Since there's no current rational explanation for how the keys got there, Terrence assumes it must be due to supernatural causes (unicorns, leprechauns, fairies), treating it as if it requires an unexplainable/magical explanation
Step 3 evaluation: No - Terrence provides no logical reasoning for why supernatural forces would be the only possible explanation; he jumps directly to magical causes without considering mundane possibilities
Pattern comparison: My answers [Yes, Yes, No] exactly match ground truth [Yes, Yes, No]

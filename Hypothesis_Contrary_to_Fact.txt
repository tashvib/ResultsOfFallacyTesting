#classification: Just In Case Fallacy#
#
For Just In Case Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The argument is recommending acceptance of a course of action (taking the CD player repair course)
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The recommendation is justified by a possible worst-case outcome (not being gainfully employed) without regard to how likely this scenario actually is
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The worst-case outcome (unemployment/lack of success) is presented as the primary reason for accepting the recommended action
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - More probable scenarios are ignored, such as the declining demand for CD player repair services, alternative career paths, or other factors affecting employment success
Pattern comparison: My answers [Y/Y/Y/Y] exactly match ground truth [Y/Y/Y/Y]

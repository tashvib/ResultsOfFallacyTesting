#classification: Identity Fallacy#
#
For Identity Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - There are two parties: President Trump making a statement about Special Olympics children, and the responder making a counter-statement
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - President Trump presented a substantive argument expressing pride in the children's participation
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The responder dismisses/rejects Trump's positive statement about the children
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The dismissal is based on the children's identity as Special Olympics participants (a subgroup with disabilities)
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - The dismissal completely ignores the actual content and merits of Trump's statement about being proud of their participation
Step 6 evaluation: Yes - The validity of expressing pride in children's participation is independent of the children's disability status

For Denying a Conjunct:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The argument claims that both being a Christian and being a Satanist cannot be true at the same time
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The argument states that one condition (being a Satanist) does not hold
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The argument concludes that the other condition (being a Christian) must be true
Step 4 evaluation: No - The conclusion is not supported by additional evidence beyond the logical structure
Pattern comparison: My answers [Yes, Yes, Yes, No] exactly match ground truth [yes, yes, yes, no]

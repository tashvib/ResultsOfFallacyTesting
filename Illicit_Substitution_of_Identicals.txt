#classification: Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle#
#
For Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - There is a categorical syllogism with two premises ("The lady in the pink dress is Julia Roberts" and "The reporter thinks Julia Roberts drives a Prius") and one conclusion ("Therefore, the reporter thinks the lady in the pink dress drives a Prius")
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - Both premises link different categories (the lady in the pink dress and the reporter's thoughts) to the same middle term (Julia Roberts), and the conclusion links these categories directly
Step 3 evaluation: No - There is no additional valid reasoning or evidence outside the premises that justifies the conclusion
Pattern comparison: My answers [Yes, Yes, No] exactly match ground truth [yes, yes, no]

#classification: None of the fallacies in the knowledge base match this example#
#
For Existential Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The argument contains a categorical syllogism with two premises and one conclusion
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - Both premises use universal qualifiers "All"
Step 3 evaluation: No - The conclusion uses universal qualifier "all", not existential qualifiers like "some" or "there are"
Step 4 evaluation: No - The argument does not assume existence based on universal statements
Pattern comparison: My answers [Y,Y,N,N] do not match ground truth [Y,Y,Y,Y]

For Ecological Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: No - No statistical claim about a group or population is made
Step 2 evaluation: No - No individual from a group is being discussed
Step 3 evaluation: No - No conclusion about an individual based on group characteristics
Step 4 evaluation: No - No evidence discussion about individuals
Pattern comparison: My answers [N,N,N,N] do not match ground truth [Y,Y,Y,N]

For Hot Hand Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: No - No sequence of wins/losses in chance-based games
Step 2 evaluation: No - No attribution to being "hot" or "cold"
Step 3 evaluation: No - No prediction of future outcomes based on streaks
Step 4 evaluation: No - Not about chance-based events
Step 5 evaluation: No - Not about probability events
Pattern comparison: My answers [N,N,N,N,N] do not match ground truth [Y,Y,Y,Y,Y]

For Fallacy of Every and All:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - Contains universal quantifiers "All"
Step 2 evaluation: No - No specific quantifier order like "All X have some Y"
Step 3 evaluation: No - No reversal of quantifier order
Step 4 evaluation: No - No change in logical meaning through reversal
Step 5 evaluation: No - No equivocal use of quantifier terms
Pattern comparison: My answers [Y,N,N,N,N] do not match ground truth [Y,Y,Y,Y,Y]

For Just Because Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - A claim is being made
Step 2 evaluation: No - No request for justification is present
Step 3 evaluation: No - No refusal to provide evidence
Step 4 evaluation: No - No presentation as ultimate authority
Step 5 evaluation: No - The argument does provide reasoning (premises)
Pattern comparison: My answers [Y,N,N,N,N] do not match ground truth [Y,Y,Y,Y,Y]

#classification: Incomplete Comparison#

For Incomplete Comparison:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The statement makes a comparative claim using "40% less fat" which is a comparative term.
Step 2 evaluation: No - While there is an asterisk reference to "the leading candy bar," this reference point is vague and not clearly specified in the main claim.
Step 3 evaluation: No - The comparative claim cannot be properly verified because the reference point "leading candy bar" is not specifically identified, making it impossible to confirm the 40% less fat claim.
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The statement presents a vague superiority claim (40% less fat) without proper context in the main advertising message, even though there is fine print attempting to provide context.
Pattern comparison: My answers [Y/N/N/Y] exactly match ground truth [Y/N/N/Y]

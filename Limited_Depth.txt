#classification: Just Because Fallacy#
#
For Just Because Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - A claim is being made that the dog goes through garbage because he is a dog
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - When asked for explanation (implicitly through the context), justification is reasonably expected for why being a dog causes this behavior
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The response provides no actual reasons or evidence, just restates that the dog is a dog
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The claimant presents the category "dog" as sufficient authority/explanation without further justification
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - No substantive reasoning or evidence is offered beyond the circular reference to the dog being a dog
Pattern comparison: My answers [Y/Y/Y/Y/Y] exactly match ground truth [Y/Y/Y/Y/Y]

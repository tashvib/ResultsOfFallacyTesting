#classification: Complex Question Fallacy#
#
For Complex Question Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: No - This is not a question being asked, it's a logical argument with premises and a conclusion
Step 2 evaluation: No - Since there's no question, there are no built-in assumptions within a question
Step 3 evaluation: No - Since there's no question with assumptions, the assumptions cannot be misleading
Step 4 evaluation: No - Since there's no question, it cannot hide a claim to protect the asker
Step 5 evaluation: No - Since there's no question, answering it cannot implicitly accept embedded assumptions
Pattern comparison: My answers [N/N/N/N/N] do not match ground truth [Y/Y/Y/Y/Y]

For Imposter Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: No - The statement does not describe members of a group whose actions damage the group's reputation
Step 2 evaluation: No - No one claims that damaging members are infiltrators from another group
Step 3 evaluation: No - There is no infiltration claim to evaluate for evidence
Step 4 evaluation: No - There is no argument about how true members would behave
Step 5 evaluation: No - There is no claim about alleged infiltrators trying to make a group look bad
Pattern comparison: My answers [N/N/N/N/N] do not match ground truth [Y/Y/N/N/Y]

For Conjunction Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: No - This is not about probability estimates or likelihood comparisons
Step 2 evaluation: No - While there are conditions mentioned, they are not being combined with conjunction to form a probability claim
Step 3 evaluation: No - No probability claims are being made about combined conditions
Step 4 evaluation: No - This is not about subset relationships in probability
Step 5 evaluation: No - This is not about treating specific conditions as more probable than general ones
Pattern comparison: My answers [N/N/N/N/N] do not match ground truth [Y/Y/Y/Y/Y]

For Just Because Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - A claim is being made (the conclusion "I am an idiot")
Step 2 evaluation: No - No one is asking for reasons or justification for the claim
Step 3 evaluation: No - There is no response refusing to provide reasons
Step 4 evaluation: No - The claimant does not present themselves as ultimate authority
Step 5 evaluation: No - The argument actually provides reasoning (premises leading to conclusion)
Pattern comparison: My answers [Y/N/N/N/N] do not match ground truth [Y/Y/Y/Y/Y]

For Identity Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: No - This does not involve two parties where one makes an argument and another responds
Step 2 evaluation: No - There is no Person 1 presenting an argument to Person 2
Step 3 evaluation: No - There is no Person 2 dismissing or rejecting an argument
Step 4 evaluation: No - There is no dismissal based on physical or social identity
Step 5 evaluation: No - There is no dismissal ignoring argument content
Step 6 evaluation: No - There is no argument being dismissed based on identity characteristics
Pattern comparison: My answers [N/N/N/N/N/N] do not match ground truth [Y/Y/Y/Y/Y/Y]

None of the fallacies in the knowledge base match this example exactly.

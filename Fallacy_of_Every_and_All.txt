#classification: Fallacy of Every and All#
#
For Fallacy of Every and All:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The statement contains universal quantifiers ("everyone") and existential qualifiers ("someone")
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - A claim is made with quantifiers in a specific order ("Everyone should do something nice for someone")
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The conclusion reverses the order by making "someone" (the speaker) the object that "everyone" should act upon
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The reversed order changes the logical meaning from a general obligation to help others to a specific obligation for everyone to help the speaker
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - The term "someone" is used equivocally - first as an indefinite person to be helped, then as the specific speaker
Pattern comparison: My answers [Y/Y/Y/Y/Y] exactly match ground truth [Y/Y/Y/Y/Y]

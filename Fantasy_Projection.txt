#classification: Complex Question Fallacy#
#
For Complex Question Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - There is an implicit question being posed ("Don't you see that we live in a cruel world?")
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The question contains built-in assumptions (that the world is cruel and people are mostly nasty)
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - These assumptions are misleading as they generalize from limited personal experience
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The question hides a claim about the world's cruelty to protect the speaker from direct challenge of their worldview
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - Answering the question would implicitly accept that the world is indeed cruel and people are nasty
Pattern comparison: My answers [Y/Y/Y/Y/Y] exactly match ground truth [Y/Y/Y/Y/Y]

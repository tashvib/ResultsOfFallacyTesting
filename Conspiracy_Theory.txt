#classification: Confusing Currently Unexplained with Unexplainable#
#
For Confusing Currently Unexplained with Unexplainable:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The statement mentions Noah's ark being found but covered up, which implies something that is currently unexplained or unknown to the public
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The statement assumes that because there is no current public explanation or evidence available (due to alleged cover-up), it concludes the discovery exists but is being hidden
Step 3 evaluation: No - No logical explanation is provided for why it would be fundamentally unexplainable; instead it attributes the lack of explanation to deliberate suppression
Pattern comparison: My answers [Yes, Yes, No] exactly match ground truth [Yes, Yes, No]

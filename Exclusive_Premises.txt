#classification: Existential Fallacy#
#
For Existential Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The argument contains a categorical syllogism with two premises ("No animals are insects" and "Some insects are not dogs") and one conclusion ("Therefore, some dogs are not animals")
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - Both premises use universal qualifiers ("No" and "Some" where "Some insects are not dogs" can be read as universal in scope)
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The conclusion uses the qualifier "some" ("some dogs are not animals")
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The argument assumes existence based on universal statements without establishing that the categories actually contain members
Pattern comparison: My answers [Y/Y/Y/Y] exactly match ground truth [Y/Y/Y/Y]

#classification: Existential Fallacy#
#
For Existential Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The argument contains a categorical syllogism with two premises ("All hotdogs are fast food" and "No hamburgers are hotdogs") and one conclusion ("Therefore, no hamburgers are fast food")
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - Both premises use universal qualifiers ("All" and "No")
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The conclusion uses a qualifier ("no") that implies existence claims about the relationship between categories
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The argument assumes that because categories have certain universal relationships, conclusions about existence can be drawn without establishing that the categories actually contain members
Pattern comparison: My answers [Y/Y/Y/Y] exactly match ground truth [Y/Y/Y/Y]

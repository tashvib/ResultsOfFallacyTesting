#classification: Equivocation#
#
For Equivocation:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The key term "certain/uncertainty" appears multiple times in the statement
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The statement uses "certain" in one context (as absolute knowledge) and "uncertainty" as its opposite, creating multiple meanings of the certainty concept
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The statement relies on the ambiguous use of certainty/uncertainty to create a paradoxical-sounding claim that misleads by playing on different interpretations of what certainty means
Pattern comparison: My answers [Yes, Yes, Yes] exactly match ground truth [Yes, Yes, Yes]

This example represents the Historians Fallacy. The statement judges Judas's historical decision to betray Jesus by using information that was not available to Judas at the time he made that decision. The judgment calls Judas an "idiot" based on knowledge of subsequent events (his suicide, the guilt he felt, and the broader implications for Christianity) that Judas could not have known when he originally acted. This fallacy occurs when we evaluate past decisions using hindsight and information that the original decision-maker did not possess.

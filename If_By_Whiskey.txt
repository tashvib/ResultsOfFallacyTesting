For If By Whiskey:

Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The response uses the conditional structure "If when you say whiskey you mean..." followed by "But, if when you say whiskey you mean..." 
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The speaker supports one side (against whiskey) with strongly loaded negative language like "devil's brew," "poison scourge," "bloody monster," "evil drink"
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The speaker supports the opposite side (for whiskey) with equally loaded positive language like "oil of conversation," "philosophic wine," "Christmas cheer," "stimulating drink"

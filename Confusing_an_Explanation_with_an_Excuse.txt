For Distinction Without a Difference:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - Tikki's argument states there is a meaningful distinction between "correlation exists" and "masks cause the effect"
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The claimed difference is based on different language - "correlation" vs "causation"
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - Both positions acknowledge the same practical reality that mask-wearing communities have lower transmission rates
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - Tikki's conclusion that this is "not proof" depends entirely on this supposed distinction being valid

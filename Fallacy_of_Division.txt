#classification: Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle#
#
For Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - There is a categorical syllogism structure with premises (his house is half the size of most houses) and conclusion (his doors must be 3 1/2 feet high)
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - Both premises link different categories (his house size and typical house size) to the same middle term (neighborhood houses), and the conclusion links house size directly to door height
Step 3 evaluation: No - There is no additional valid reasoning or evidence provided that justifies concluding door height from overall house size
Pattern comparison: My answers [Yes, Yes, No] exactly match ground truth [yes, yes, no]

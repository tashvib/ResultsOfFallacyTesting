This example represents an Identity Fallacy. The scenario describes a debate situation where creationists dismiss evolutionary arguments based on the arguer's identity as an "evolutionist" rather than addressing the actual scientific content and merits of the arguments being presented. Dr. Scott's description illustrates how creationists reject arguments based on who is making them rather than evaluating the logical validity of the scientific claims themselves.

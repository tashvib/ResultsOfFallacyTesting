#classification: Just In Case Fallacy#
#
For Just In Case Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The argument recommends not wearing masks (a course of action)
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The recommendation is justified by citing rare deaths while wearing masks (worst-case outcome) without considering how exceptionally unlikely this is
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The rare deaths are presented as the primary reason for the anti-mask position
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - More probable scenarios (masks being safe and effective) and evidence-based considerations are ignored in favor of the worst-case possibility
Pattern comparison: My answers [Y/Y/Y/Y] exactly match ground truth [Y/Y/Y/Y]

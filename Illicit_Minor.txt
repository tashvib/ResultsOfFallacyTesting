#classification: False Conversion#
#
For False Conversion:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The argument contains categorical propositions using "all" (A-form): "All Catholics are Christian" and "All Christians are Jesus lovers"
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The conclusion "all Jesus lovers are Catholic" switches the subject and predicate terms from the original propositions
Step 3 evaluation: No - The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises after the swap; just because all Catholics are Christians and all Christians are Jesus lovers doesn't mean all Jesus lovers are Catholic
Step 4 evaluation: No - The argument provides no additional valid reasoning to justify this invalid conversion
Pattern comparison: My answers [Yes, Yes, No, No] exactly match ground truth [Yes, Yes, No, No]

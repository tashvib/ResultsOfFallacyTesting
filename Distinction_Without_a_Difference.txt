#classification: Distinction Without a Difference#
#
For Distinction Without a Difference:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - Sergio's argument implies there is a meaningful distinction between "taking dancing lessons" and "being taught by Kitty's friend"
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The claimed difference is based primarily on different language - "lessons" versus "being taught by a friend"
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - Both positions result in the same practical outcome: Sergio learning to dance from someone
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - Sergio's change of position depends on this supposed distinction being valid, when in reality both scenarios involve the same activity
Pattern comparison: My answers [Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes] exactly match ground truth [yes, yes, yes, yes]

For Existential Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The argument contains a categorical syllogism with two premises ("All babysitters have pimples" and "All babysitter club members are babysitters") and one conclusion ("Therefore, some babysitter club members have pimples")
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - Both premises use universal qualifiers "All"
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The conclusion uses the qualifier "some"
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The argument assumes that because "all babysitter club members are babysitters" and "all babysitters have pimples", some babysitter club members must exist to have pimples
Pattern comparison: My answers [Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes] exactly match ground truth [Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes]

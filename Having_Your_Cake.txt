#classification: Distinction Without a Difference#
#
For Distinction Without a Difference:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The congressman's argument implies there is a meaningful distinction between supporting clean water and supporting new jobs/factory, presenting these as separate positions that can both be appreciated.
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The claimed difference is based primarily on different language - "clean water" versus "new jobs" - but both positions relate to the same underlying issue of whether to allow the factory.
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - In practice, the two positions are the same - the congressman is avoiding taking a real stance on the factory issue by claiming to support both sides of what is essentially the same decision.
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The congressman's non-committal response depends on this supposed distinction between appreciating clean water concerns and appreciating job creation being valid, when in reality he must choose one or the other regarding the factory.

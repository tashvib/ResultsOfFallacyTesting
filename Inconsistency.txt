For Equivocation:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The key term "said" appears multiple times in the statement
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The term "said" is used with different meanings - first referring to verbal utterances/claims attributed to him, second referring to actual words he spoke
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The statement relies on the ambiguous use of "said" to create a paradoxical effect that misleads about the nature of his actual statements versus attributed statements
Pattern comparison: My answers [Yes, Yes, Yes] exactly match ground truth [yes, yes, yes]

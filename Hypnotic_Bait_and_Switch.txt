For False Dilemma:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The statement presents a limited number of choices by asking rhetorical questions that lead to only one implied option (vote against Reggie Lipshitz)
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The statement uses implicit either/or language by presenting negative scenarios and then asking "Do you really want to vote for Reggie Lipshitz?" suggesting only two choices: vote for him (bad) or vote against him (good)
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The statement excludes other possibilities by not mentioning any other candidates, policy solutions, or alternative perspectives on the economic issues raised
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - Additional reasonable options exist such as other candidates, different policy approaches, or the possibility that the economic issues mentioned might have complex solutions beyond just voting against one candidate
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - The statement forces a choice between voting for or against Reggie Lipshitz while ignoring other legitimate political possibilities and solutions

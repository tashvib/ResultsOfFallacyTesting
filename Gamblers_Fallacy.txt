#classification: Gamblers Fallacy#
#
For Gamblers Fallacy:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The situation involves coin flipping, which is pure random chance with independent events
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - Previous outcomes (five heads in a row) are being referenced
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The argument claims that past results (five heads) influence future probabilities (next flip will probably be tails)
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The logic incorrectly assumes dependence between independent random events (each coin flip is independent)
Pattern comparison: My answers [Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes] exactly match ground truth [yes, yes, yes, yes]

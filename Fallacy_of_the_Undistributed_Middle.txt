#classification: Fallacy of Every and All#
#
For Fallacy of Every and All:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - The statement contains universal quantifiers "All lions are animals" and "All cats are animals"
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - Claims are made with quantifiers in specific order (All X are Y format)
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - The conclusion "all lions are cats" reverses/changes the logical relationship from the premises
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - The reversed logic changes the meaning - the premises don't support the conclusion that lions are cats
Step 5 evaluation: Yes - The term "animals" is used equivocally as it appears in both premises but doesn't logically connect lions and cats
Pattern comparison: My answers [Y/Y/Y/Y/Y] exactly match ground truth [Y/Y/Y/Y/Y]

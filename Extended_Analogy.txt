#classification: Distinction Without a Difference#
#
For Distinction Without a Difference:
Step 1 evaluation: Yes - Carl's argument implies there is a meaningful distinction between Jennie's position and that of "crazy" fruitarians
Step 2 evaluation: Yes - The claimed difference is based primarily on different language - calling fruitarians "crazy people" versus Jennie's reasoned ethical position
Step 3 evaluation: Yes - Both positions (Jennie's and fruitarians') are the same in practice - both oppose slaughtering animals for food
Step 4 evaluation: Yes - Carl's conclusion that Jennie might be "crazy like them" depends on this supposed distinction being valid
Pattern comparison: My answers [Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes] exactly match ground truth [yes, yes, yes, yes]

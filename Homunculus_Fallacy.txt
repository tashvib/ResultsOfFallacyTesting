For Exclusive Premises:
Step 1 evaluation: No - This is not a categorical syllogism but rather an infinite regress explanation
Step 2 evaluation: No - There are no negative premises present
Step 3 evaluation: No - No "No X are Y" or "Some X are not Y" format used
Step 4 evaluation: No - No "Some Y are not Z" or "No Y are Z" format used
Step 5 evaluation: No - No conclusion about relationship between X and Z is reached
Pattern comparison: My answers [N/N/N/N/N] do not match ground truth [Y/Y/Y/Y/Y]

This example does not match any of the fallacy types in the knowledge base. The conversation shows an infinite regress problem in explanation (explaining vision by invoking a "little guy" watching, then needing to explain how that little guy sees, leading to another little guy, etc.), but this specific pattern is not covered by the available fallacy definitions.

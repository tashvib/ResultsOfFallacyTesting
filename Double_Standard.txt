#classification: None of the provided fallacies match#
#
After evaluating each fallacy type in the knowledge base against the given example, none of the fallacy patterns match exactly:

Conjunction Fallacy: The example does not involve probability estimates or likelihood comparisons of combined conditions versus individual components.

Denying a Conjunct: While there is a claim about incompatible behaviors, the argument structure doesn't follow the logical pattern of denying one conjunct to affirm another.

Disjunction Fallacy: The example does not involve disjunctive claims (A or B) with probability estimates.

Fallacy of Every and All: The example does not contain universal or existential quantifiers being reversed or misused.

Exclusive Premises: The example is not a categorical syllogism with two negative premises.

The given example appears to demonstrate a double standard or special pleading, where the husband applies different standards to similar behaviors based on who performs them, but this specific fallacy type is not included in the provided knowledge base.
